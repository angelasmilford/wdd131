                    <h2>Micronesian Culture</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Micronesian culture refers to the beliefs and practices of the indigenous people from the Micronesian region. 
                        The region is situated between Philippines and Hawaii, covering over 2,000 high islands and low coral atolls grouped into several countries and/or territories. 
                        Micronesia includes Guam, Nauru, Marshall Islands, Kiribati, Northern Mariana Islands, and Federated States of Micronesia.

                    <h2>Language</h2>
                    <p>
                        Micronesia houses fifteen distinct languages, such as Chuukese, Pohnpeian, Marshallese, Palauan, etc. 
                        Micronsian language derived from the Proto-Oceanic language. 
                        These language are passed down and preserved through story-telling, songs, and oral traditions. 
                        One language that's unfortunately gone extinct was the Banabans language.

                    <h2>Arts</h2>
                    <p>
                        To produce music, Micronesian used either drums, ukuleles, or their voices. 
                        Originally, the only instrument Micronesian had access to were their voices. 
                        They would do chants that narrate folklore, historical events, or spiritual stories, or sing songs about their abilities or deeds.

                    <h2>Religion</h2>
                    <p>
                        Micronesians initially practiced animism, which emphasized worship of ancestors and embraced spirits/ghosts. 
                        Today, the widely practiced religion in Micronesia is Christianity. 
                        After the missionaries were introduced, Christianity became a dominant religion, blending with tradition beliefs.
