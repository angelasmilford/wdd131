                    <h2>Micronesian Culture</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Micronesian culture refers to the beliefs and practices of the indigenous people from the Micronesian region. 
                        The region is situated between Philippines and Hawaii, covering over 2,000 high islands and low coral atolls grouped into several countries and/or territories. 
                        Micronesia includes Guam, Nauru, Marshall Islands, Kiribati, Northern Mariana Islands, and Federated States of Micronesia.

                    <h2>Language</h2>
                    <p>
                        Micronesia houses fifteen distinct languages, such as Chuukese, Pohnpeian, Marshallese, Palauan, etc. 
                        Micronsian language is derived from the Proto-Oceanic language. 
                        These language are passed down and preserved through story-telling, songs, and oral traditions. 
                        One language that has unfortunately gone extinct is the Banabans language.

                    <h2>Arts</h2>
                    <p>
                        Micronesian art encompasses weaving, carving, dance, music, tattooing, and oral story-telling. 
                        These reflect the region's deep connection with nature, navigation, and community life. 
                        The art forms they create carry spiritual, cultural, and functional meanings.

                    <h2>Religion</h2>
                    <p>
                        Micronesians initially practiced animism, which emphasized worship of ancestors and embraced spirits/ghosts. 
                        The widely practiced religion in Micronesia today is Christianity. 
                        After the missionaries were introduced, Christianity became a dominant religion, blending with tradition beliefs.
